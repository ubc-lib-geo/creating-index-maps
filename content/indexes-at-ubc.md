Our goal is to convert our existing paper map indexes to digital (spatial geometry + sheet ID) and create a spreadsheet inventory (sheet ID and other OpenIndexMaps compatible info) <b>for prioritized Canadian or other important map series</b>. When this happens, we can join the two files in GIS.

OpenIndexMaps compatible index maps benefit map collections because they provide a sheet-level inventory for map series which would otherwise be described using one single catalogue record, and allow us to easily visualize and spatially examine paper map collections. These standardized inventories can also be:

- shared with other institutions to compare and understand collections
- ingested into discovery interfaces such as GeoBlacklight to enable spatial discovery
- used locally for internal look-up processes such as using spreadsheet or web map applications
- used in research to understand patterns in Canadian map making and publishing
