Goal is to simultaneously create geospatial index files (showing the extent of each map sheet in a map series) + spreadsheets (containing rows of metadata that describe each sheet according to OpenIndexMaps (OIM) best practices). Once a spreadsheet and a geographic index file is created for a UBC map series, they can then be joined in GIS to create a complete OIM compatible index map.

OIM index maps benefit map collections because they provide a sheet-level inventory for map series which would otherwise be described using one single catalogue record. These standardized inventories can be:

- shared with other institutions to compare and understand collections
- ingested into discovery interfaces such as GeoBlacklight to enable spatial discovery
- used locally for internal look-up processes such as using spreadsheet or web map applications
