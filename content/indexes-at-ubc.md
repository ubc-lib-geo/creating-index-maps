Goal is to simultaneously create geospatial index files (showing the extent of each map sheet in a map series) + spreadsheets (containing rows of metadata that describe each sheet according to OpenIndexMaps (OIM) best practices). Once a spreadsheet and a geographic index file is created for a UBC map series, they can then be joined in GIS to create a complete OIM compatible index map.
