Information about how to manually create a non-rectilinear index is coming soon!
<!--
This can be done to create blank rectilinear grids. If the grid is not rectilinear:

- if it has a paper map index: [scan and trace](#)
- if it does not have a paper map index, but it does have lat long at the corners: [create spreadsheet with lat and long columns](#)
- if it does not have a paper index nor a lat long at the corners, then use geojson.io or QGIS to [create the index manually](#)
