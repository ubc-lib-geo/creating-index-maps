Some stuff about the map collection, and finding maps in grids. Spatial index = index map

Some stuff about Open Index Maps and GeoBlacklight
- both for sharing holdings, and for spatial discoverability
- without GeoBlacklight, could use Mapbox GL JS

Highlight the work of librarians who've made advances here

Goal for UBC, how do we do that?
