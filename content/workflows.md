<!--
The goal is to have a digital map index (spatial geometry + sheet ID) and a spreadsheet inventory (sheet ID and other OIM compatible info) for prioritized map series. When these two files exist, then we will link the two using the sheet ID in QGIS.

For existing digital indexes with an OpenIndexMap "label" field <b>and</b> a UBC map inventory, [clean the inventory](clean-inventory.md) to OpenIndexMap standards. Then in QGIS we'll create a virtual layer .

For existing digital indexes with an OpenIndexMap "label" field, [create an inventory spreadsheet with "label" column](create-oim-spreadsheet.md).

For existing digital indexes <b>without</b> an OpenIndexMap "label" field, [create a "label" field and populate](modify-dig-index.md)
