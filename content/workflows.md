The goal is to have (1) a digital map index (spatial geometry + sheet ID) and (2) a spreadsheet inventory (sheet ID and other OpenIndexMap-compatible information) for prioritized map series. When these two files exist, we will link them using the sheet ID in QGIS.

For existing digital indexes with an OpenIndexMap "label" field **and** a UBC map inventory, [clean the inventory](clean-inventory.md) to OpenIndexMap standards. Then, in QGIS, we'll [create a virtual layer](create-virtual-layer-qgis.md) to link the two.

For existing digital indexes with an OpenIndexMap "label" field, [create an inventory spreadsheet with the "label" column](create-oim-spreadsheet.md).

For existing digital indexes **without** an OpenIndexMap "label" field, [create a "label" field and populate](modify-dig-index.md).
