# Creating map indexes

This content is meant to help staff at UBC Library understand index maps, and to direct work toward creating digital index maps for some of our map collections using the OpenIndexMap content format standard.

For more information about the what a map index is and their importance in map collections see ["What are index maps?"](content/what-are-index-maps.md)

[more to come]
