A common practice when mapping large geographic areas was to divide an area into smaller sections, so that each one could be drafted in greater detail and printed on manageable sizes of physical paper. These sections making up a "map series" are extremely common in map collections containing maps from the 20th century, as war-time events created an effort to survey expanses of lands for military purposes, or as industrialization drove a desire to inventory natural resources.    

<q>"Map series" = several map sheets representing one body of work</q>

An example of a map series is the [International Map of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Map_of_the_World) (AKA the Millionth Map AKA the "IMW"). This was the first major international effort to map the entire earth at a consistent scale (1:1 million) and with standardized cartographic style. Before this map series, world maps only existed at scales of around 1:20 million or more, and on normal map-sized paper this meant that details needed to be limited. The IMW essentially allowed the entire, continuous world to be mapped in much greater detail. The map index for the IMW is defined by parallel lines of latitude and longitude, with each section being 6 degrees x 6 degrees. A cartesian-like system was created to identify each section according to it's row and column above and below the equator so that each section could be logically and uniquely named. In library's, we use this grid as an index to describe, find and arrange collections.

Index maps have been an important finding aid for map collections in Libraries for the last several decades. These indexes act as spatial "table of contents" for the maps contained in a series of maps. They are important for users to determine which sheet covers a particular location â€“ information that cannot be adequately described in a traditional catalogue record.

Over time libraries, started using spatial technologies to extend discoverability of map collections. For instance, [GeoBlacklight](https://geoblacklight.org/) is a discovery interface for maps and geospatial data, which uses lat/long coordinates in a map's descriptive metadata to reveal relevant resources when a user zooms a map to a particular location.

Some stuff about Open Index Maps and GeoBlacklight
- both for sharing holdings, and for spatial discoverability
- without GeoBlacklight, could use Mapbox GL JS

Goal for UBC, how do we do that?
